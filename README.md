# RPS Game Book Rules

RPS stands for Rock Scissor Paper. RPS Game Books that let you play a game of Rock Scissor Paper by yourself.  

## Why Would You Play Rock Scissor Paper By Yourself? What Is The Point? 

Glad you ask fictional person questioner. Let me explain.

The original purpose for this project is that I wanted to make nifty little art books and zines with a *technically* functional game in them and include a custom six sided die. The idea is that these would make a nifty collectible to sell at conventions, include as freebies in orders, and a PDF bundle of these books could easily be sold or shared digitally. 

The game itself isn't intended to deep or challenging. It is probably less challenging than a game of Candy Land. The point is that they are collectibles similar to trading cards but more substantial than trading cards.

There three restriction. 
1) Attribution must be made (according to the licenses).
2) Indication if changes to the rules were made.
3) All modifications to the rules, such as but not limited to additions or improvements, are also licensed as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International. So that the next person can also use those modifications.

The last restriction is the most important to me because the next kid, artist, game designer that comes along shouldn't worry about using modified version of the rules or making their own modifications and then having someone come after them for any reason. That will probably never going to happen for this game but according to the license it can't happen. I spent to much time looking for something like to use as a starting point for my own work and couldn't find anything that didn't have catches, "gotchas", weren't clear if they were available to use, or were entirely to complex for me to meaningfully use. So I made my own project and I want everyone else to be able to use it too. 

Yes this is just a simple game of rock scissor paper with a book. It doesn't need to be this complicated. But people can be dicks about the dumbest things.
