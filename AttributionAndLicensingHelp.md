Attribution for the RPS Game Book Rules has three parts, the sentence stating how the rules are licensed, the url to the rules on GitHub, and the url to the full text of the license.

# Attribution Help

Here are some example of use the attribution in various situations.

## I'm not publishing or selling books (Personal Use)

If you are not publishing or selling books because you are just making a hand full for personal use like giving them as gifts, personal amusement, or making them as art projects with kids then don't worry about it. You just can't claim ownership of the game rules or stop others from making their own books using the rules.   

## I'm making a book with a Credits Page or Publishing/Copyright Information Page

Use the plain text attribution in the credits or put in on the page with all the publishing and copyright information. 

## I'm making a small art book or zine that doesn't have credits or publishing information

If your book, zine, art project or whatever form it takes doesn't have a credits or publishing information then include the attribution somewhere on your website or social media. 

### Examples of where to put it on your website
 - On the page that talks about the book/art project.
 - In the product description if you are selling it online.

The point is to make it clear you are not claiming ownership of the rules and that others can use them to make their own books or other works with the rules.

## I don't have a website, I'm not selling them online

If all the following art true
- You don't have a website 
- You don't have any form of social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr 
- You are not selling the books online.
- You are only personally selling the books face to face.

Then don't worry about it. Technically you are required to give attribution but if you are only ever selling your books personally at conventions, fairs, or out of your trunk then no one really is going to know if you are giving proper attribution. The point of the license is to prevent other people from stopping you from making books or other works using the rules but likewise to prevent you from doing the same to others. Please give attribution the best you can and don't be a dick.    

## I'm Just Kid

If you are under the age of 18 or helping kids make their own books as an activity or school project then don't worry about it. You are exactly the people I'm trying to protect with the license. You have the freedom to do whatever you want with the books including selling them. You just can't stop other people from making their own books. 

If you are teenager making books for fun or even selling them at a convention you are 100% free to do so. No worries if you can't figure out a way to include the attribution. Do the best that you can.

If you are 18 or older and trying to money on your art then you need to give attribution so it is clear you are not claiming ownership of the game rules. If you are just starting out and you are making books that don't have credit or publishing pages in your books but you also don't have a website or any social media accounts yet then don't worry about attribution right now. Just make sure you put the attribution somewhere as soon as you can. The point is that you can't stop other people from using the rules or making their own game books and others can't stop you from doing the same. Just don't be a dick.

## I'm going to be pedantic about the license

If you are going to be spoil sport then read the license carefully and follow it accordingly.

# Why so much trouble for a book that lets you play a game of rock scissors paper by yourself?

Two reasons

1) I want to make it easy for people trying to use the game rules for their own projects and protect them from unscrupulous parties and opportunist.  

2) Because there are pedantic people out there that will take any opportunity to make any harder for others. Life it to short to be a dick.
